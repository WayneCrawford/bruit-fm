 # WP1: Seafloor Signal Separation and Noise Removal

[Work Package Management Site](https://resana.numerique.gouv.fr/public/perimetre/consulter/121579#)

WP1 will animate collaborations between participants and WPs.
A management committee consisting of one representative of each partner will ensure that the funds are appropriately
expended and that temporary posts are properly advertised and are selected in a timely manner.
We will share and evaluate scientific results and work advancement at biannual meetings.
A small operations budget will allow us to invite outside researchers to participate in these meetings.

The Data Management Plan (DMP) will be based on putting and retrieving data to/from FDSN- compatible data centers (RESIF if
collected using French instruments).
Enhanced data will be proposed to the data center: if it cannot distribute the data, the DMP will specify how to make it publicly available.

Open Science guidelines will reiterate ANR-required guidelines for publications and specify rules for making available
codes developed during the project (publication of all software on an open-software site (e.g. GitLab) and distribution
of operating software on open-software deployment sites (e.g., PyPI).
