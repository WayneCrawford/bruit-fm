# WP2: Full Seafloor Spectrum

This WP consolidates the cross-WP tasks of dataset selection and validation, reducing work in each WP
and choosing datasets with more cross-WP interest. This WP will also quantify seismological noise levels
and compile a a full-spectrum vision of the results of WPs 3-5. 

[Work Package Management Site](WP2)

## Objectives

- Establish a catalogue of existing data (by oceans and world regions) and
  how to access them.
- Establish a catalogue of ocean bottom noise signals and their sources.
- Determine the seafloor pressure noise floor.
