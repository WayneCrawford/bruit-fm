# WP3: The Generation of Global Seismological Noise

This WP will develop an integrated model of seafloor and land seismological noise validated by
measurements. We will use broadband datasets from the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Atlantic oceans to
generate noise models and evaluate the key features of each ocean.

## Objectives

- Develop an integrated model of broadband (0.02-1 Hz) seafloor noise validated by measurements
- Better understand the physics of the sources of broadband noise and the noise floor in this
frequency band
- Improve the quality of ambient noise data selection for compliance analysis
- Provide a catalogue of broadband sources that can be used for tomographic application
