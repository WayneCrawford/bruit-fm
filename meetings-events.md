# Meetings and Events

Management meetings are scheduled every 6 months (Management comittee + WP leaders)

Project meetings are scheduled once a year, an ANR report will be made after each one

WP/task meetings will be held as needed.

Should there be a "jour fixe" (2h/month) for the WP/task meetings, so that people can block off a date on their calendar?
